			<h2><u>My Projects</u></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>Project 1</h3>
					<p><u>Details about the project</u>- I developed an object detection system using Python and the OpenCV library. The system uses a pre-trained YOLOv3 model to detect objects in input images, including their class, confidence score, and bounding box coordinates. The system can be extended to detect objects in real-time video streams and can be trained on custom datasets for specific applications. This project has applications in self-driving cars, security systems, and robotics.
